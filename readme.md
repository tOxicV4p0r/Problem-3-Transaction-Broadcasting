# Transaction Broadcasting and Monitoring

## Description
This module can broadcast a transaction of cryptocurrency price and monitor its status until it is confirmed or failed. It supports multiple currencies like `ETH` and `BTC` and so on.

## Features
- Broadcasts transactions with `symbol`, `price`, and `timestamp` then wait until it is confirmed or failed after that return transaction status and hash.

## Example usage 
Broadcasting and Monitoring a Transaction
   ```javascript
    const { broadcastAndCheckTransactionStatus } = require('./BroadcastTransaction');

    (async () => {
        // Example of broadcasting an Bitcoin price
        const { txHash, txStatus } = await broadcastAndCheckTransactionStatus('BTC', 1000000);
        // Example response
        // {
        //      txHash: '849be0c867ae16b4bbd052282b9d0d202f123ff0ca0dd090660e77d61c649322',
        //      txStatus: 'CONFIRMED'
        // }
        console.log(`Transaction status: ${txStatus}`);
        console.log(`Transaction hash: ${txHash}`);

    })();
   ```
## Transaction Status
Each transaction status returned by the module indicates a different state of the transaction in the blockchain network.
* **`PENDING`** Transaction is awaiting processing
* **`COINFIRMED`** Transaction has been processed and confirmed
* **`FAILED`** Transaction failed to process
* **`DNE`** Transaction does not exist
* **`TIMEOUT`** Reaches the maximum of waiting time without a confirmed or failed status
